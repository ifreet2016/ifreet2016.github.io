# Twitch stream search
----------------
- Write a simple web app that hits the Twitch API URL shown at the top (there are API docs online)
- Use JSONP when utilizing the Twitch API's
- Build the URL based on the query entered by the user in the search box shown in the mock
- Build out the list as shown in the mock. 
- All UI elements are mandatory and self-explanatory
- Feel free to add more/better UI, as long as you include the mandatory elements
- No frameworks like jQuery/AngularJS.  Just vanilla JS with XHR to hit the API.
